## Hello, 

I am a math postdoc at Georgia Tech. I am currently working on projects related to the recovery of signals that possess various structural properties such as sparsity, or signals generated by iterations of an operator. 

I use my GitHub account to post research and class related material, as well as the small projects I play with for fun. 

You can find additional info on my website at [petrosyan.page](https://petrosyan.page).
